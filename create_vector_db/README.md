# Vector Database
    
A Vector Database is a data storage system optimized for efficient 
similarity search, enabling the retrieval of vectors or embeddings with 
similar characteristics, often used in applications like natural language 
processing and image recognition.

### Steps to set up and run the project in your local system
    
The purpose of this project is to get some hands on experience on Vector 
Database using FAISS.

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command in your terminal:
```git clone <repository_url>```

2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd <project_directory>```

3. Install the requirements: ```pip install requirements.txt```

4. After the installation is successful, select the {vector_database}_result as per your use case so you need to run 
```python Response.py```

5. You will be prompted to Select your vector database, you need select your appropriate database and in the terminal 
and click enter.

6. Then you will be again prompted to enter your query in the terminal, and the program will provide the required output.

Feel free to explore and modify the code in the Query.py file for your
